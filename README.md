# Project-Calculator
This is the Calculator project from TOP(the odin project) foundations course.

This project is about building an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The website will consist of a main html index page, a css page and javascript page.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a website using my JAVASCRIPT knowledge.

Self-reflection and conclusion: This project was an opportunity to test my javascript knowledge.

Future Improvement:
enable the dot(.) to not erase zero: writing 0.1 instead of .1

enable the calculator to use the negative (+/-) on a number
like -2*2 = -4
