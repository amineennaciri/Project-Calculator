# Project-Calculator
This is the Calculator project from TOP(the odin project) foundations course.

This project is about building an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The website will consist of a main html index page, a css page and javascript page.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a website using my JAVASCRIPT knowledge.

Self-reflection and conclusion: This project was an opportunity to test my javascript knowledge.

Future Improvement:
enable the dot(.) to not erase zero: writing 0.1 instead of .1

enable the calculator to use the negative (+/-) on a number
like -2*2 = -4



# TO DO
# Gotchas: watch out for and fix these bugs if they show up in your code:

# Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. Example: you press a number button (12), followed by an operator button (+), a second number button (7), and finally a second operator button (-). Your calculator should then do the following: first, evaluate the first pair of numbers (12 + 7), second, display the result of that calculation (19), and finally, use that result (19) as the first number in your new calculation, along with the next operator (-).

# You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.

# Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!
# Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.. make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”

# Add a shining feature on my button

# Extra Credit

# Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)

# Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.

# Add keyboard support! You might run into an issue where keys such as (/) might cause you some trouble. Read the MDN documentation for event.preventDefault to help solve this problem.
